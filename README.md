# Web Application Course Repository

Welcome to the Web Application Development course repository! This repository is dedicated to the materials and exercises of the course for the second semester of the first year in the Master of Science in Cybersecurity program. The course, taught entirely in English, emphasizes building distributed web applications with a strong focus on front-end development using JavaScript and popular client-side frameworks.

## Course Overview

This course introduces the core techniques for creating distributed web applications with an emphasis on the front-end. Through this course, students will gain hands-on experience with modern web development by:

- Writing and analyzing native JavaScript.
- Exploring the functionalities of a leading client-side framework.
- Understanding and applying key security principles in browser-based applications.

## Topics Covered

- **Web Fundamentals**: Overview of web architectures, HTML5, and CSS.
- **Design & Layouts**: Creating intricate layouts using CSS frameworks and mastering web design principles.
- **JavaScript Basics**: Key concepts including variables, objects, and the execution environment both in browsers and NodeJS.
- **DOM Manipulation & Event Handling**: Effective management of the DOM, events, forms, tables, callbacks, and closures.
- **Server-Side Development**: Introduction to web server development with ExpressJS, using package managers, and understanding associated security practices.
- **Data Handling & Asynchronous Operations**: Working with JSON, HTTP APIs, and implementing asynchronous programming techniques (async/await, Promises, Fetch API).
- **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**: Fundamentals of reactive programming and the basics of ReactJS.
- **React Development**: Building dynamic applications with React components and JSX.
- **Security Techniques**: Deep dive into authentication, authorization (including API tokens, signatures), and server-side input validation.
- **Application Architecture**: Exploring complex architectures, event routing, and state management for scalable applications.
- **Web Security Best Practices**: Addressing common security issues and implementing robust security measures.
